JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD. IT THROWS THE ENTIRE FLAVOR AND TEXTURE DYNAMIC OFF! IT ADDS A DELICIOUS SWEETNESS TO THE PIZZA THAT'S TO DIE FOR! IT OVERPOWERS THE PIZZA'S NATURAL FLAVOR AND SALTINESS. IT ALSO MAKES THE PIZZA TOO MUSHY. IT CEASES TO BE WHAT A PIZZA IS MEANT TO BE. YOU MIGHT AS WELL START MAKING BROTH AND SOUPS OUT OF SODA WHILE YOU'RE AT IT."

It is replicable! All you would need to do is study the thousands of public posts on that list in the same 12 months as the researcher. This study is not replicable because it would be too difficult to find the topics the researcher analyzes without names. Ethnography is about obtaining textured insights into social phenomenon and illuminating meaning \u2013 such as the micro-level nuances of attitudes, not claiming quantifiable facts that need to be proven as Truth. As a positivist, if it can\u2019t be replicated it is not scientific knowledge."

EXCEPT THAT A MAJORITY OF HIS FEATS WERE EITHER RENDERED NON-CANON, DEBUNKED, INCONSISTENT, OR HIGHLY EXAGGERATED! GOKU ALSO MANAGED TO BECOME A GOD IN HIS LIFETIME THROUGH TRAINING AND ACHIEVED ULTRA INSTINCT COMPLETELY ON ACCIDENT AMONG OTHER VARIOUS FEATS ANALOGOUS TO SUPERMAN'S! HE IS THE GOLD STANDARD FOR COMICS, ESPECIALLY DC! HE WAS THE FIRST SUPERHERO, TOO! EVERYTIME HE IS IN A PINCH, HE MANAGES TO COME OUT ON TOP! THEN GOKU IS THE PLATINUM, PRACTICALLY WITH HAIR TO MATCH. HE MANAGED SIMILARLY TIME AND AGAIN! CRUCIALLY, IN THE TOURNAMENT OF POWER WHEN HIS BACK WAS AGAINST THE WALL! YOU KNOW DAMN WELL SUPERMAN IS A MODEL-T FORD! HE WAS GREAT FOR HIS TIME BUT OTHERS WITH LEGITIMATE PLOT ARMOR HAVE BESTED HIM! EVEN BATMAN MANAGED TO ONE-UP HIM AND GOKU MAKES BATMAN LOOK LIKE A NOVICE! NO DOUBT HE HAS ACHIEVED THE MEANS TO BEST SOMEONE WHO BREAKS THE LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS SUNTANNING, GOD POWER OR NOT!"
